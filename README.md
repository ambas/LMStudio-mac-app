**LMStudio - Mac App**

A rhyming answer, I shall provide with flair!

**Overview**

This is a SwiftUl app that uses the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF model to generate responses. It allows users to input a prompt and receive a response in rhyme.

**Code Styling Issues**

There are **4** messages related to code styling that can be fixed by an auto code formatter:
1. Indentation (consistent spacing)
2. Line breaks (consistent line wrapping)
3. Whitespace (trailing spaces and tabs)
4. Quotes (consistent use of double quotes or backticks)
These formatting issues can be easily resolved with a code beautifier or a linter!
